Works with your subscriptions on Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode, Antigravity, Pi, omp, fx, and Hermes Agent. If they’re installed and logged in, MonoCode-Copilot can run them. Tabs are sessions. The composer is the input. MonoCode-Copilot does not sell tokens.

## Install

> Install and log in to at least one provider first:
>
> - [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) - `claude auth login`
> - [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) - `codex login`
> - [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-cli) - `copilot login`
> - [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) - `agent login`
> - [Grok Build](https://docs.x.ai/build/overview) - `curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash` then `grok login`
> - [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) - `opencode auth login`
> - [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli-install) (macOS/Linux) - `curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash`, then run `agy` once to sign in
> - [Pi](https://pi.dev/) - `npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`
> - [omp](https://omp.sh) - `curl -fsSL https://omp.sh/install | sh`
> - [fx](https://fx.sh) - `curl -fsSL https://fx.sh/setup.sh | bash` then `fx login`
> - [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) - macOS/Linux: `curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash`; Windows PowerShell: `iex (irm https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.ps1)`; then run `hermes model`

macOS (Apple Silicon): download the [latest MonoCode-Copilot DMG](https://github.com/wanyest/monocode-copilot/releases/latest), open it, and drag MonoCode-Copilot to Applications.

## Some notes

Experimental remote sessions: run agents on an always-on Windows, Linux, or macOS machine and connect from the desktop. See [remote access setup and current limitations](docs/remote-access.md).

This is very early and you should expect bugs.

### Agent access to MonoCode

Type `/operator` at the start of a composer message to enable MonoCode access in that thread. For example, `/operator start two Codex sessions: one to inspect the API and one to review the UI`, or `/operator list my notes`. The slash picker also offers this command. The transcript shows only the request text in a translucent amber bubble; MonoCode removes the command from the request sent to the agent and supplies the local `app` CLI path and instructions on that turn. Later turns in the same thread can use the CLI without repeating `/operator`; other threads receive no CLI instructions or app access. The CLI can act only during an active agent turn. The agent can run the shown `app --help` command for the exact JSON input fields.

- `models.list` shows available providers, models, settings, and permission modes.
- `sessions.start` opens a tab in the current project with a prompt. Set `placement: "right"` or `placement: "down"` to split the calling session's pane instead; `besideSessionId` selects another visible session pane in the project. Reuse the returned session ID as the next `besideSessionId` to build nested layouts. By default it submits the prompt; set `draft: true` to save it unsent without starting an agent turn. It accepts a provider, model, effort or other model settings, permission mode, and current checkout or new worktree choice. Set `worktreeCwd` to a path from `worktrees.list` for a specific existing checkout. Use `worktrees.create` to create a worktree on a named new or existing local branch, then pass its path as `worktreeCwd`. Omit `runtimeMode` to inherit the calling session's permission mode, or set it explicitly to override. It returns the new session ID as soon as the pane and prompt are accepted, so the agent can move it into a folder immediately.
- `sessions.list` shows project sessions. `sessions.read` returns up to three recent user/assistant exchanges, with a cursor for older exchanges and a per-message character cap. `sessions.send` submits a follow-up to an idle session, while `sessions.draft` saves an unsent message for the user to review. `folders.list` and `folders.move` organize project sessions in sidebar folders, including a new folder.
- `notes.list` returns titles and short previews; `notes.read` returns one full note by ID.

Orchestration workers keep their existing scoped `control` workflow and do not receive this app access.

Small, focused pull requests are welcome. Anything large is worth an issue first - see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Build from source

This Copilot fork builds and releases for macOS only. The cross-platform source inherited from upstream remains in the repository to keep upstream merges manageable, but this fork does not run Windows or Linux builds.

Need Node.js 20+ and a current stable Rust toolchain.

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

To run the standalone Copilot-branded app variant:

```bash
npm run tauri:copilot
```
